# Version constraints for pip-installation.

# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.
#
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.

# openapi-spec-validator==0.5.0 requires jsonschema>=4.0 but aws-sam-translator requires jsonschema~=3.2
# This constraint can be removed once aws-sam-translator updates the constraint
# and https://github.com/aws/serverless-application-model/issues/2426 is resolved.
